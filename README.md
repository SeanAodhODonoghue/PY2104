[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mkenne15/PY2104/main)

**Module Objective**: To introduce students to the fundamentals of thermal and statistical physics.

**Module Content**: Laws of thermodynamics, statistical interpretation of entropy and temperature, thermodynamic potentials and Maxwell's relations, Boltzmann distributions, Joule effect and Joule -Thompson effect, phase transitions, Clausius-Clapeyron equation, ideal gases, cyclic processes.

**Learning Outcomes**: On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:

1. show familiarity with the 3 laws of thermodynamics and know how to apply them;
2. show familiarity with the various thermodynamic potentials (energies) and how to work with them,
3. be able to derive the four thermodynamical Maxwell's relations and know how to apply them,
4. know the characteristic properties of and ideal gases and cyclic processes and how to apply them,
5. be familiar with common manifestations of the non-ideal nature of real gases
6. know the characteristic properties of phase transitions and phase diagrams
7. show familiarity with the concepts of basic statistical physics, including an understanding of and ability to work with the partition function and quantities derived from the partition function.

**Assessment**: Total Marks 100: Formal Written Examination 80 marks; Continuous Assessment 20 marks (4 assignments, 3 marks each & 2 in-class tests, 4 marks each).

**Compulsory Elements**: Formal Written Examination; Continuous Assessment.
